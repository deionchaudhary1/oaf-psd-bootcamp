Job Parser Application
GOAL: Through a GUI, a user is able to input their job preferences and this program outputs a list of jobs that fit them. 
Making their overall job searching experience easier in this time of job shortages.

Data Source: Adzuna's Job Advertising API
    - This API holds a great amount of Job Listings and various endpoints that I can use in my application
    to greater give the user more choices in what kind of jobs they wish to see.
Data Storage: SQLite3
    - SQLite3 will help us give a database of user input, jobs given to the user, and testing
    - Also, im not fully sure on what SQLite will be used for so I am guessing
Data Utilization: Allowing a user to simply get jobs that apply to them
    - Using the data that the user inputs for their job preferences, I use the API
    to call for jobs that fit those requirements and output them for the user to look through
    and hopefully apply to.

Design of my project:
    main.py - will create the CLI and call all other functions
    project.py - house the mock and API classes
        will follow same structure as weatherApp
    security.py - will handle the login aspect of the project (use sqlite3 as well)
